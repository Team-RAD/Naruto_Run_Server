#### Team Structure

The RAD team met up prior to project commencement to bond, clarify objectives and assign roles to better aid in our development process, thus maximizing our chances of a successful build.

Roles were assigned as follows:

- Ryan: RAD team leader and client-side lead
- Adam: Testing lead, database manager as well as utility between front-end and back-end build
- Dave: Concept design and server-side lead

We also decided our team would work together literally not just figuratively so we set up our HQ at Ryan’s house and spent every day of this project physically working side-by-side (keeping covid-safe of course).

Although the RAD team worked synergistically to complete the build of our application (which included lots of team-based programming, research, problem solving, and crossovers into each other’s arenas) we all had our specific duties we were ultimately responsible for. This ensured every key aspect of Naruto Run’s design, implementation, and testing had a specific member of the RAD team responsible for its success.

- Ryan's total contribution to the Naruto Run project: 33%
- Adam's total contribution to the Naruto Run project: 33%
- Dave's total contribution to the Naruto Run project: 33%
- 1% goes to Ryan's dogs Franklin and Cammy, without whom none of this would be possible.

#### Tech Stack:

- MongoDB for data storage

#### Server-Side Libraries:

_Dependencies:_

- Body-parser: extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body as something easier to interface with.
- Connect-Mongo
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin
- Express-Session
- Mongoose: manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB is a mongodb driver for node
- Passport: Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node. js.
